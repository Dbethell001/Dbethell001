I am an *International Software Engineer*  that thrives on establishing a bridge between Humans and Deep Learning / Artificial Intelligence.

> The Human-Brain Artificial-Intelligence Matrix is an innovative technology that cognitively interlaces the human brain with AI machines to perform functions once perceived as incapable. (H Ouya et al. 2021)

**My passion is just that - to be the link between humans and artificial intelligence.** 
1. To delve into consumer problems and solve them with innovative technology once known as impossible. 
2. To innovate technology that elevates- brings individuals closer together than ever before. 
3. Most importantly, to make the impossible possible again for humans. 
4. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new projects to cultivate my knowledge in the digital world.

Some technologies that I enjoy working with are *Javascript & CSS for Web Design, API's, and Cloud Software - DropBox, Amazon AWS, Google Drive and Slack.*
